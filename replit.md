# Pilgrim's Daily Grace — replit.md

## Overview

**Pilgrim's Daily Grace** is a Christian devotional mobile app built with Expo/React Native. The app provides daily spiritual affirmations, devotionals, a prayer journal, community prayer wall, and gamified faith progression tracking. It targets iOS and Android (portrait orientation only), with web support as well.

Core features:
- **Daily Affirmations**: Rotating biblical affirmations across 10 spiritual categories (faith, healing, hope, etc.)
- **Devotionals**: Daily readings with scripture, reflection, and prayer
- **Prayer Journal**: Personal journal entries with mood tracking
- **Community Wall**: Shared prayer requests with support interactions
- **Growth Tracking**: Streaks, badges, levels, and a multi-dimensional growth score
- **Background Worship Music**: Streaming ambient worship tracks via expo-av

## System Architecture

### Frontend (Mobile App)
- **Framework**: Expo SDK ~54 with React Native 0.81, using the **Expo Router** file-based navigation system
- **Navigation structure**:
  - `app/(tabs)/` — five tab screens: Today (home), Categories, Journal, Community, Profile
  - `app/category/[id]` — dynamic category detail screen
  - `app/journal/new` — modal for creating journal entries
  - `app/devotional` — card-presentation devotional reader
- **UI approach**: Custom theming via `constants/colors.ts` with full light/dark mode support. Theme is driven by `AppContext` which respects system preference or manual override.
- **Fonts**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700) loaded via `@expo-google-fonts/inter`
- **Animations**: `react-native-reanimated` for spring/fade animations; `expo-haptics` for tactile feedback
- **Platform handling**: Conditional logic for iOS, Android, and web throughout components (e.g., `webTopInset`, keyboard behavior, blur effects)
- **Tab bar**: Uses `expo-glass-effect` for Liquid Glass on supported iOS; falls back to BlurView/standard tabs on other platforms

### State Management
- **Global app state**: React Context via `AppContext` — holds user stats, journal entries, community prayers, badges, theme, and streak logic
- **Music state**: Separate `MusicContext` manages expo-av Audio playback, track cycling, and volume
- **Persistence**: `AsyncStorage` (`@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`) stores all user data locally (stats, journal, community prayers, theme preference, music settings)
- **Server data**: `@tanstack/react-query` is wired up for server-side fetching (currently minimal API usage)

### Content Data
- **Affirmations**: Statically defined in `constants/affirmations.ts` — 10 categories, ~40+ affirmations per category, with daily rotation based on day of year
- **Devotionals**: Also static in `constants/affirmations.ts`, with daily rotation
- **Badges/Levels**: Defined in `constants/badges.ts` — 14 badges across 5 types, 10 levels with names (Seed → Crown of Glory)

### Backend (Express Server)
- **Framework**: Express 5 (`server/index.ts`) with TypeScript, bundled via esbuild for production
- **Current state**: Minimal — `server/routes.ts` is a skeleton with no application routes yet. The server mainly serves as an API host and static file server for the web build.
- **Storage layer**: `server/storage.ts` provides a `MemStorage` class (in-memory user store) implementing an `IStorage` interface — designed to be swapped out for a real database implementation
- **CORS**: Configured to allow Replit dev/deployment domains and localhost origins

### Database
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect (`drizzle.config.ts`)
- **Schema** (`shared/schema.ts`): Currently only a `users` table (id, username, password) — minimal foundation
- **Validation**: Drizzle-Zod for schema-derived TypeScript types and insert validation
- **Status**: Database is provisioned but largely unused — all user data currently lives in AsyncStorage on-device

### Build & Deployment
- **Dev mode**: Metro bundler via `npx expo start --localhost`, proxied through Replit dev domain
- **Production build**: Custom `scripts/build.js` handles static Expo web export, then Express serves those files
- **Environment**: `EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` used by the client to construct API URLs; `REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN` and `REPLIT_DOMAINS` used for CORS and build configuration
